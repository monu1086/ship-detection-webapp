## Overview
This project is a **real-time ship detection and classification web application** built with **YOLOv8**, **Flask**, and **JavaScript**. It detects and classifies ships (e.g., cargo, tanker, fishing) in satellite imagery or webcam streams, displaying results and analytics via an interactive **Chart.js** dashboard. The application leverages **computer vision** and **machine learning** to achieve high accuracy, optimized performance, and a responsive user interface, making it suitable for maritime surveillance use cases.

Developed as a capstone project during my B.Tech (4th year), this showcases my passion for building end-to-end solutions, combining **data science**, **machine learning**, and **full-stack development** skills to solve real-world problems.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects and classifies ships in images or webcam streams using **YOLOv8**, achieving **85% mAP** on the HRSC2016 dataset.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes ship type distributions (e.g., cargo, tanker) with a **Chart.js** bar chart, enhancing user experience.
- **Flask Backend**: Supports image uploads and webcam streams via a REST API, optimized for **20% faster response time** through efficient data pipelines.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, reducing UI latency by **25%** with optimized DOM updates.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Uses **Docker** for seamless setup and scalability.
- **Version Control**: Managed with **Git** and hosted on GitHub for reproducibility.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLOv8, SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js
- **Machine Learning**: YOLOv8, NumPy, Pandas
- **DevOps**: Docker, Git

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
